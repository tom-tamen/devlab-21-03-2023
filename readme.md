# Devlab creative dev 21/03/2023
For this devlab, we made a little game that is played with the camera.
Indeed, it is possible to control a spaceship with your head.
You just have to put your head in the right area (bottom right of the screen) to make the ship move.
We realized this project with ml5.js for the detection of the movement with the camera.
It is also possible to play with a keyboard, here are the controls:
 - Move left : left arrow
 - Move right : right arrow
 - Pause and play : p
 - Restart : r
 
Have fun :)
